    <h3>Current SDN Controller</h3>
    <p>We are currently using the OS-Ken SDN framework, which is a maintained fork of our previously used RYU (pronounced &quot;ree-yooh&quot;) SDN framework. The two frameworks haven&apos;t diverged much, so much so that programs using either frameworks work nearly interchangeably, save for some need to replace &quot;RYU&quot; with &quot;OS-Ken&quot;.</p>

    <p>RYU has some example programs located on <Link to="https://github.com/faucetsdn/ryu/tree/master/ryu/app">GitHub</Link>, which are great stubs for building a custom controller of our own. We initially based our programs on <Link to="https://github.com/faucetsdn/ryu/blob/master/ryu/app/simple_switch_13.py">simple_switch_13.py</Link>, which needs some slight modification to work with our physical switches in the lab. These RYU programs can work with os-ken, you will just need to rename imported methods from &quot;RYU&quot; to &quot;OS-Ken&quot;. See the &quot;Lab Configuration&quot; tab for controller configuration changes that are needed to interact with the HP 2920-24G network switches we use in the lab.</p>
